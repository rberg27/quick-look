Q: What is the best method for repainting an image in context? Is there an advantage for using a transformer to encode orientation opposed to CNNs?

Specific Q: What type of projector used during contrastive learning can be used to generate scene specific embeddings to create more stylistically accurate scenes?

How to run the code:

run byo-main.py


This code was developed in Cursor - an AI integrated IDE environment. I used the claude-sonnet-3.7 model to co-develop the code. I also used the IOPaint repository from github (www.github.com/Sanster/IOPaint) to use the LMD model to generate painted infills to masked images.
